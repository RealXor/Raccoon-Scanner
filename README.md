# Raccoon-Scanner
An easy and lightweight (soonâ„¢) library of detecting Java packers / obfuscators with an easy drag and drop. No need to deobfuscate a class,
determine the obfuscator and adjust your transformers accordingly. Do a simple drag and drop and begin the deobfuscation process!

# Special Thanks
On any normal readme, this would've been put at the end. But because I'm actually having so much fun working on this project, I'd like to thank everyone right away.
  * ItzSomebody (Delivering great samples)
  * Cubxity (for support of the project)
  * Many more

# What does this not do
Raccoon Scanner will not support or make any attempt of retransforming the obfuscated classes, it will only check for certain code signatures obfuscators have.
The process of collecting obfuscated source code is a long, and annoying process. 

# I'd like to submit samples
That's great! There is a standard for obfuscated jar files though. These must contain at least **5** obfuscated classes and there's a minimal of
**3** jar files to be given. So thats 3 jar files; each containing a minimal of **5** obfuscated classes.

# How to use
_This will be worked on once the Raccoon stops being lazy, and begins to function like it's supposed to_
