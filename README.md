# Raccoon-Scanner
An easy and lightweight (soonâ„¢) library of detecting Java packers / obfuscators with an easy drag and drop. No need to deobfuscate a class,
determine the obfuscator and adjust your transformers accordingly. Do a simple drag and drop and begin the deobfuscation process!

# What does this not do
Raccoon Scanner will not support or make any attempt of retransforming the obfuscated classes, it will only check for certain code signatures obfuscators have.
The process of collecting obfuscated source code is a long, and annoying process. 

# I'd like to submit samples
That's great! There is a standard for obfuscated jar files though. These must contain at least **5** obfuscated classes and there's a minimal of
**3** jar files to be given. So thats 3 jar files; each containing a minimal of **5** obfuscated classes.

# How to use
